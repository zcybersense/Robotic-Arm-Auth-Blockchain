# Project Title:
Secure Robotic Arm Control Using Face Authentication, Wyze Cam, and Blockchain

# Description:

This project integrates robotics, computer vision, and cybersecurity to create a secure and intelligent robotic control system. The system uses a Wyze Cam v3 for real-time facial authentication, a Raspberry Pi 4 as the central processing hub, and an Arduino-controlled Adeept Robotic Arm for physical interaction. User authentication is verified through facial recognition using OpenCV and face_recognition. Once authorized, commands are sent to the Arduino to control servo motors. All control events are logged securely using blockchain technology, ensuring data integrity and traceability.
